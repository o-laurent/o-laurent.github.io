## Code

I am the main contributor of [TorchUncertainty](https://github.com/ENSTA-U2IS/torch-uncertainty) a package designed to help leverage uncertainty quantification techniques and make deep neural networks more reliable. This repository also includes tutorials on diverse techniques of uncertainty for deep neural networks. The documentation is available [here](https://torch-uncertainty.github.io/).
